# Projects

## Description: 
I have compiled a diverse collection of projects that I have completed while undertaking during my HyperionDev Data Science Bootcamp, leveraging the power of Python and Jupyter Notebook. These projects exhibit my expertise and proficiency in various aspects of data science, covering various topics and techniques.

### Installation: To run this project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command: https://github.com/mssci92/finalCapstone
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd finalCapstone
3. Open your web browser and paste the file URL you want to access or download.
4. For PDF files, the file will open directly in your browser, and you can read or download it from there. You can use the browser's built-in PDF viewer or choose to download the file to your local machine.
5. The Jupyter Notebook files will be displayed on GitHub, but you won't be able to run the code or interact with it directly on the web page. To run the notebook and interact with the code, you must set up a Jupyter Notebook environment on your local machine.
6. If Jupyter Notebook is installed, click the "Raw" button in the GitHub file view to see the raw code. Then, you can copy the code and save it as a .ipynb file on your local machine. Open the file in Jupyter Notebook to run and interact with the code.
7. If you don't have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can install it by following the instructions provided on the official Jupyter website: https://jupyter.org/install. Once installed, you can save the notebook file from GitHub and open it in Jupyter Notebook to run and interact with the code.
8. To run the Python script files, make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once installed, navigate to the location where you saved the Python script files and run it.

### Additional installation guidance: To run specific programmes which requires a text file/cvs file(s) or libraries installed
1. The data programs in Python/Juypter Notebook will require you to install libraries spaCy, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.pyplot. Ensure you install Python on your system before executing these commands. Once the installations are complete, you can import and use NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.pyplot in your Python programs. Use the following commands in your command prompt/ terminal for:
1. Installing NumPy:
   pip install numpy

2. Installing Pandas:
   pip install pandas

3. Installing Matplotlib:
   pip install matplotlib

4. Instally spaCy:
   pip install spacy
   To download and install a specific language model for spaCy, you can use the following command:
   python -m spacy download <language_model>
   Replace <language_model> with the name of the language model you want to install. For example, to install the English language model, you would use:
   python -m spacy download en
2. The Dataset program requires installing the text file "balance.txt" to function correctly. Please ensure you have downloaded the "balance.txt" file and placed it in the same directory as your "Datasets Compulsory Task.ipynb" file.
3. The Report program requires installing the text file "balance.txt" to function correctly. Please ensure you have downloaded the "balance.txt" file and placed it in the same directory as your "Report.ipynb" file
4. The Similar Linear Regression program requires installing the comma-separated values file "insurance.cvs" to function correctly. Please ensure you have downloaded the "insurance.csv" file and placed it in the same directory as your "Simple+linear+regression+insurance.ipynb" file.
5. The Semantic Similarity program requires installing the text file "movies.txt" to function correctly. Please ensure you have downloaded the "movies.txt" file and placed it in the same directory as your "watch_next.py" file.

### Usage: 
1. The Finance program is a calculator which a user can use to calculate bonds or investments in a house.
2. The Simple calculator program is a calculator which a user can use to carry out any of the four operations (add, subtract, divide and multiply) of two numbers. Your calculations are stored and can be displayed when requested.
3. The Holiday program calculates the cost of flights, hotels, and car hire and total costs for four destinations (Paris, Cancun, New York, Tokoyo). Please note that these values have been made up for practice purposes.
4. The Minesweeper program identifies the position of all adjacent "#" symbols and converts the "-" symbols to a count value representing the number of adjacent "#" symbols that have been located.
5. The PDF files are not programmes. They are research tasks on NLP and ML applications and Data Visualisation analysis.
6. The Datasets program retrieves and explains information from the "balance.txt" file using the pandas library.
7. The Report program which produces a report of information from the "balance.txt" file using the pandas library.
8. algorithm, to create accurate insurance charge predictions based on a customer's age, and visualised the results using the numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot libraries and sklean.linear_model class from the skilearn module.
9. The Garden program program identifies the tokens and entities found in the Garden sentences.
10. Semantic Similarity program which creates a function to which movies a user would watch next if they have watched Planet Hulk based on the word vector similarity of the description of movies.
