# finalCapstone
##Project Name: Capstone project - NLP

##Description: PDF file which cases with the type of NLP application. Another PDF which details how IBM uses a NLP technology called Watson in the medical field.

###Table of Contents:
NLP 1:  https://github.com/mssci92/finalCapstone/blob/main/nlp_1.pdf
NLP 2:  https://github.com/mssci92/finalCapstone/blob/main/nlp_2.pdf
Simple linear regression: https://github.com/mssci92/finalCapstone/blob/main/Simple%2Blinear%2Bregression%2Binsurance.ipynb
Semantic Similarity: (https://github.com/mssci92/finalCapstone/blob/main/watch_next.py)


###Installation: To run this project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command: https://github.com/mssci92/finalCapstone
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd finalCapstone
3. Open your web browser and paste the URL of the file you want to access or download.
4. For PDF files (NLP 1 and NLP 2), the file will open directly in your browser, and you can read or download it from there. You can use the browser's built-in PDF viewer or choose to download the file to your local machine.
5. For the Jupyter Notebook file (Simple linear regression), the file will be displayed on GitHub, but you won't be able to run the code or interact with it directly on the web page. To run the notebook and interact with the code, you'll need to set up a Jupyter Notebook environment on your local machine.
6. If you already have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can click on the "Raw" button in the GitHub file view to see the raw code. Then, you can copy the code and save it as a .ipynb file on your local machine. Open the file in Jupyter Notebook to run and interact with the code.
7. If you don't have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can install it by following the instructions provided on the official Jupyter website: https://jupyter.org/install. Once installed, you can save the notebook file from GitHub and open it in Jupyter Notebook to run and interact with the code.
8. To run the Python script file watch_next.py, make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once installed, navigate to the location where you saved the watch_next.py file and run it.

###Usage: The NLP files are not programmes,they are research tasks on NLP applications. Semantic Similarity is a programme which creates a function to which movies a user would watch next if they have watched Planet Hulk based on the word vector similarity of the description of movies. Simple linear regression is a programme building a predictive model to forecast insurance charges based on data. I applied Simple linear regression, a machine learning algorithm, to create accurate insurance charge predictions based on a customer's age, and visualised the results
